# Sies  

Sies is a mobile app that helps users find the perfect clothing size across brands by learning from the garments they already own. Instead of relying on generic size charts, Sies builds a **personalized fit profile** using brand-specific size guides, garment measurements, and user feedback.  

---

## Install Node.js dependencies
`npm install`

## Development mode
`gulp`

## 🚀 Features
- **TagMatch**: Scan or upload a photo of a clothing tag, and Sies finds the exact product online along with its measurements.  
- **Closet-Based Fit Profile**: Add a few favorite garments to your digital closet. Sies uses their measurements to predict your size across brands.  
- **Fit Zones**: Personalized “Tight / Perfect / Relaxed” fit preferences that adapt dynamically based on user feedback.  
- **Interactive Prototype**: Explore how Sies compares garment fits visually with recommendations powered by brand size guides.  
- **Landing Page Preview**: A marketing site designed to showcase how Sies works and validate user interest.
