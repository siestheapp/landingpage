_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning tool updates**

I need to provide status updates before and after each tool call, but I'm skipping the todo list this time. I'll confirm any changes made and take into account other files related to “2profile.html,” like “index3” with IDs “demo” and “profile.” 

Now, I see “3profile.html” as an untracked file, and the embed is set up with a relative path. Since "index3.html" is in the same directory, it should work. I’ll also keep in mind potential scaling and styling differences, but I’m moving ahead with applying the patch.</details></think>

I'll update `index3.html` to replace both iframe references to `2profile.html` with `3profile.html`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Following developer guidelines**

I'm working within the developer agent framework. The user wanted references replaced, and I used the apply_patch tool for that. I need to give a status update since I called a tool. This change is straightforward, and while the instructions say I can skip creating a todo list, I still need to manage them according to the guidelines. I should also consider checking for linter errors in the HTML file and run read_lints on it for diagnostics, as it aligns with the spec.
**Updating tool call procedures**

I need to provide a summary at the end, using bullet points to summarize the changes made. I'll also include a status update before any tool calls, which is important. Even though I've already called a tool, I still have to add this update, just like the previous assistant did when they said, "I'll update..." So, I should write something like, "Making the swap now," at the top of the message before any further tool calls, ensuring everything aligns with the guidelines.
**Clarifying tool call updates**

The spec clearly states that if I make a tool call, I need to include a micro-update near the top of the message beforehand. In my previous assistant messages, I did have "I'll update `index3.html`..." before the tool call, but that was in a different message. The second message only included the tool call without a prior status update. It's essential that I follow the rule to include an update in the same turn as any tool calls, even if they are split across messages.
**Ensuring compliance with tool calls**

The framework allows multiple tool calls in one assistant message, but it looks like there's been a misstep earlier. I can’t change what’s happened, but I need to rectify it in my final answer by including a status update and potentially more tool calls, like read_lints. I should start with an update, saying, "I replaced the references; I'll check for linter issues." Then I will run read_lints on index3.html. I’ll also provide a summary since we’re not using todos. Let’s go ahead and call read_lints!</details></think>

I replaced both iframe references to `2profile.html` in `index3.html` with `3profile.html`. I'll quickly check for any linter issues in `index3.html`.

- Swapped `2profile.html` to `3profile.html` in two iframes within `index3.html` (profile spotlight and demo mockups).
- No linter issues detected in `index3.html`.
