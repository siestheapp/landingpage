# Link video mockup to dress listing (2025-09-01 03:00-0400)

_**User**_

if someone clicks on the video mockup at the top of @index3.html , lets hyperlink the video frame so it takes them to the dress listing - @https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/the-jocelyn-sleeveless-slip-midi-dress-by-maeve?category=top-rated-dresses&color=256&type=STANDARD&quantity=1 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a hyperlink to the video mockup in the hero section so that clicking on it takes users to the dress listing on Anthropologie.

Perfect! I've wrapped the video mockup in the hero section with a hyperlink that will take users to the Anthropologie dress listing when clicked. The changes include:

1. **Added hyperlink**: Wrapped the `.mock` div with an `<a>` tag pointing to the Anthropologie URL
2. **Target="_blank"**: Opens the link in a new tab so users don't lose their place on your site
3. **Preserved styling**: The `class="mock"` and `aria-hidden="true"` attributes are now on the anchor tag to maintain the existing visual styling

Now when visitors click anywhere on the video mockup in the hero section, they'll be taken directly to the dress listing page. The video will still autoplay and loop as before, but it's now clickable and interactive.

it extends outside the video frame now...make it confined to the frame

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to adjust the CSS to ensure the clickable area is confined to the video frame. Let me add some CSS to constrain the link to the proper boundaries.

Perfect! I've added CSS to ensure the clickable link area is confined to the video frame boundaries. The key changes:

1. **Added `display: inline-block`** to the `a.mock:has(video)` selector - this makes the link only take up the space of its content
2. **Added `overflow: hidden`** to ensure any overflow is clipped
3. **Set `display: block`** on the base `.mock:has(video)` to maintain proper layout

Now the clickable area will be constrained to exactly the visible video frame area, so users won't accidentally click on invisible areas around the video. The link will only be active when clicking directly on the video itself.

_**User**_

no the hyperlink stll extends outside the video frame to the right and left

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The link is still extending beyond the video frame boundaries. Let me fix this by adding more specific CSS to constrain the clickable area to match the actual video dimensions.

Now I've constrained the clickable area more precisely:

1. **Added `width: fit-content`** to the link so it only takes up the space of its content
2. **Set specific width** on the `.mock-inner` to match the actual scaled video dimensions (`calc(430px * 0.655)`) 
3. **Added `margin: 0 auto`** to center the video frame
4. **Added `max-width: 100%`** for responsive behavior

This should now confine the clickable area to exactly match the visible video frame boundaries, preventing clicks from registering outside the actual video area.

how do we add tracking to the different mockups so we can see what potential users click on

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add tracking to the different mockups so you can see what potential users are clicking on. Let me add event tracking using JavaScript that you can connect to analytics services like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar.

dont implement im just asking

---

_**Assistant**_

Got it! Here are some ways you could add tracking to the different mockups to see what users are clicking on:

## Tracking Options:

**1. Google Analytics 4 Events**
- Add `gtag('event', 'mockup_click', { mockup_type: 'hero_video' })` to track clicks
- Can track: hero video, closet mockup, profile mockup, feed mockup

**2. Simple Custom Analytics**
- Send events to your own endpoint: `fetch('/api/track', { event: 'mockup_click', type: 'hero_video' })`
- Store in your database for analysis

**3. Third-party Analytics**
- Mixpanel: `mixpanel.track('Mockup Clicked', { type: 'hero_video' })`
- Amplitude, PostHog, etc. have similar event tracking

## What to Track:

**Mockup Interactions:**
- Hero video click (already linked to Anthropologie)
- "How it works" closet mockup clicks
- Profile spotlight mockup clicks  
- Demo section mockup clicks (closet, profile, feed)

**Additional Data to Capture:**
- Time spent on page before clicking
- Scroll depth when clicked
- Device type (mobile/desktop)
- Referrer source

**Event Names You Could Use:**
- `hero_video_clicked`
- `closet_mockup_clicked` 
- `profile_mockup_clicked`
- `feed_mockup_clicked`

This would give you insights into which mockups are most engaging and where users are most interested in interacting with your product demos.

_**User**_

how would we add these and would it cost money?

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's how you'd add tracking and the costs involved:

## Implementation Methods:

**1. Google Analytics 4 (FREE)**
```html
<!-- Add to <head> -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>

<!-- Add to mockup clicks -->
<script>
  document.querySelector('.hero-video').addEventListener('click', () => {
    gtag('event', 'mockup_click', {
      'mockup_type': 'hero_video',
      'mockup_location': 'hero_section'
    });
  });
</script>
```

**2. Simple Custom Tracking (FREE - just server costs)**
```javascript
function trackClick(mockupType) {
  fetch('/api/track', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      event: 'mockup_click',
      type: mockupType,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      url: window.location.href
    })
  });
}
```

## Cost Breakdown:

**FREE Options:**
- **Google Analytics 4**: Completely free, handles millions of events
- **Custom tracking**: Free code, just need a simple endpoint on your server
- **Plausible Analytics**: â‚¬9/month for privacy-focused analytics

**Paid Options:**
- **Mixpanel**: Free up to 100K events/month, then $25+/month
- **Amplitude**: Free up to 10M events/month, then $61+/month  
- **PostHog**: Free up to 1M events/month, then $0.00031/event

## Recommendation:
Start with **Google Analytics 4** - it's free, easy to implement, and gives you everything you need. You can always add more sophisticated tracking later if needed.

The implementation would just be adding a few script tags and click event listeners to your existing mockups.
