in @3profile copy.html :
Here’s exactly what to change so the treemap uses your Coolors palette but renders as soft, glazed pastels (not heavy blocks).

1) Swap the category colors to Coolors

Replace your CATEGORY_HUES with the Coolors hexes:

const CATEGORY_HUES = {
  tops:    '#9B7AAD', // African Violet
  dresses: '#D2F1E4', // Mint Green
  bottoms: '#0D3B66', // Yale Blue (we'll soften it)
  all:     '#CFC7E8'  // fallback
};

2) Soften every hue (less saturation, a bit lighter)

Add this helper right under colorHex():

// pastel-ize: gently desaturate and lift lightness
function softenColor(hex){
  const c = colorHex(hex);
  const hsl = { h:0, s:0, l:0 };
  c.getHSL(hsl);
  // soften saturation ~15–25% and lift lightness ~6–18%
  const darkLift = hsl.l < 0.35 ? 0.18 : 0.10; // Yale Blue needs more lift
  hsl.s *= 0.80;
  hsl.l = Math.min(0.96, hsl.l + darkLift);
  c.setHSL(hsl.h, hsl.s, hsl.l);
  return c;
}


Then update variantColor() to start from the softened color:

function variantColor(hex, seed){
  const c = softenColor(hex);          // start pastel
  const wobble = (Math.sin(seed * 12.9898) * 43758.5453) % 1;
  const amt = (wobble - 0.5) * 0.10;   // tighter range: -5%..+5%
  c.offsetHSL(0, 0, amt);
  return c;
}


(This keeps all tiles in a calm pastel family; Yale Blue becomes airy instead of heavy.)

Perfect! I've successfully updated the treemap colors in `3profile copy.html` to use your Coolors palette with soft, glazed pastels. Here's what was changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Category Colors to Coolors Palette:**
   - `tops`: `#9B7AAD` (African Violet)
   - `dresses`: `#D2F1E4` (Mint Green) 
   - `bottoms`: `#0D3B66` (Yale Blue - will be softened)
   - `all`: `#CFC7E8` (fallback)

2. **Added `softenColor()` Function:**
   - Gently desaturates colors by 20% (`hsl.s *= 0.80`)
   - Lifts lightness by 10-18% depending on how dark the original color is
   - Yale Blue gets extra lift (18%) since it's quite dark
   - Caps maximum lightness at 96% to avoid pure white

3. **Updated `variantColor()` Function:**
   - Now starts with the softened pastel color instead of the raw hex
   - Reduced wobble range from ±7% to ±5% for more subtle variation
   - Maintains the calm pastel family across all tiles

The treemap will now render with your Coolors palette as soft, glazed pastels rather than heavy blocks. The Yale Blue will become airy and light, while the African Violet and Mint Green will maintain their character but in a more gentle, pastel form.

3) Nudge the shader to keep things light

Lower the “glimmer” contribution a touch so color doesn’t get too intense. In your fragment shader (frg) change the three lines that add g1/g2/g3 to:

col += uBase * vec3(1.03,1.02,1.05) * 0.16 * uBoost * g1;
col += uBase * vec3(1.04,1.03,1.00) * 0.18 * uBoost * g2;
col += vec3(1.0) * 0.10 * uBoost * g3;


(Everything else in the shader can stay as-is; the stronger white “core” you already have will make dark hues read as glazed, not dense.)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the fragment shader to reduce the glimmer contribution and keep the colors lighter. Let me find and modify those specific lines:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the fragment shader to reduce the glimmer contribution and keep the colors lighter. Here's what was changed:

## Shader Updates:

**Reduced Glimmer Intensity:**
- **g1 contribution**: `0.22` → `0.16` (27% reduction)
- **g2 contribution**: `0.26` → `0.18` (31% reduction) 
- **g3 contribution**: `0.12` → `0.10` (17% reduction)

**Slightly Adjusted Color Multipliers:**
- **g1**: `vec3(1.05,1.02,1.07)` → `vec3(1.03,1.02,1.05)` (more subtle)
- **g2**: `vec3(1.06,1.05,1.00)` → `vec3(1.04,1.03,1.00)` (more subtle)
- **g3**: unchanged (pure white)

These changes will ensure that:
- The pastel colors remain light and airy
- The glimmer effects are more subtle and don't overwhelm the base colors
- The existing white "core" effect will still make dark hues (like the softened Yale Blue) read as glazed rather than dense
- The overall visual effect is more refined and less intense

The treemap tiles will now have a more delicate, glazed appearance that complements the soft Coolors palette perfectly.

4) (Optional) Make the “All” view even calmer

When “All” is selected, slightly de-emphasize non-active tiles. You already pass uBoost; keep 1.0 for the selected category and ensure “All” sets every tile to 0.9:

function makeTileMaterial(tile, size, activeCategory){
  const catHue = CATEGORY_HUES[tile.cat] || CATEGORY_HUES.all;
  const base   = variantColor(catHue, (tile.x+tile.y+tile.w+tile.h) * 0.001);
  const allView = (!activeCategory || activeCategory === 'all');
  const boost  = allView ? 0.9 : (activeCategory === tile.cat ? 1.0 : 0.7);
  // ...
}

I'll update the `makeTileMaterial` function to make the "All" view even calmer by slightly de-emphasizing all tiles when "All" is selected. Let me find and modify that function:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the `makeTileMaterial` function to make the "All" view even calmer. Here's what was changed:

## Boost Logic Update:

**New Behavior:**
- **"All" view**: All tiles get `boost = 0.9` (slightly de-emphasized)
- **Category-specific view**: 
  - Selected category tiles get `boost = 1.0` (full emphasis)
  - Other category tiles get `boost = 0.7` (de-emphasized)

**Previous Behavior:**
- "All" view gave all tiles `boost = 1.0` (full emphasis)
- Category-specific view was the same as now

## Visual Effect:

This change will make the "All" view feel more balanced and less overwhelming by:
- Slightly reducing the intensity of all tiles when viewing the complete closet
- Creating a more harmonious, calmer overall appearance
- Maintaining clear visual hierarchy when filtering by specific categories
- The 10% reduction in boost (1.0 → 0.9) is subtle but noticeable, making the mosaic feel more refined

The treemap will now have a more sophisticated visual hierarchy where the "All" view provides a gentle overview, while category-specific views create clear focus on the selected items.

1) Pastel-ize harder (fix for dark hues)

Replace your softenColor() with this:

function softenColor(hex){
  const c = colorHex(hex);
  const hsl = { h:0, s:0, l:0 };
  c.getHSL(hsl);

  // stronger desat + bigger lightness lift for dark bases (e.g., Yale Blue)
  const lift = hsl.l < 0.45 ? 0.30 : 0.16;
  hsl.s *= 0.65;                         // down from 0.80 → calmer pastels
  hsl.l = Math.min(0.97, Math.max(0.88, hsl.l + lift)); // clamp to airy floor

  c.setHSL(hsl.h, hsl.s, hsl.l);
  return c;
}


And tighten the wobble in variantColor() so tiles don’t dip back into dark:

const amt = (wobble - 0.5) * 0.06; // was 0.10

I'll update the `softenColor()` function to pastel-ize harder and fix the dark hues, plus tighten the wobble in `variantColor()`. Let me make these changes:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the color softening functions to pastel-ize harder and fix the dark hues. Here's what was changed:

## `softenColor()` Function Updates:

**Stronger Desaturation:**
- Saturation multiplier: `0.80` → `0.65` (35% reduction instead of 20%)

**Enhanced Lightness Lifting:**
- **Dark colors** (l < 0.45): Lift increased from `0.18` → `0.30` (67% more lift)
- **Light colors** (l ≥ 0.45): Lift increased from `0.10` → `0.16` (60% more lift)
- **Threshold**: Changed from `0.35` to `0.45` to catch more colors as "dark"

**Airy Floor Clamping:**
- **Minimum lightness**: Now `0.88` (was no minimum)
- **Maximum lightness**: Increased to `0.97` (was `0.96`)
- This ensures all tiles stay in the "airy" range and don't dip back into darkness

## `variantColor()` Function Updates:

**Tighter Wobble Range:**
- Wobble multiplier: `0.10` → `0.06` (40% reduction)
- Range: ±3% instead of ±5%
- This prevents tiles from accidentally dipping back into dark territory

## Visual Effect:

These changes will ensure that:
- **Yale Blue** becomes much more airy and pastel-like
- **All colors** maintain a consistent "airy" appearance
- **No tiles** will accidentally become too dark or saturated
- The overall mosaic has a more cohesive, gentle pastel aesthetic
- The color variations between tiles are more subtle and refined

The treemap will now have a much more consistent, airy pastel appearance with no dark spots or heavy blocks.

2) Keep non-active categories lighter

Tweak the boost when a filter is not selected:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the boost logic to create better visual hierarchy. Here's what was changed:

## Boost Logic Updates:

**"All" View:**
- Changed from `0.9` → `1.0` (full emphasis for all tiles)

**Category-Specific View:**
- **Selected category**: `1.0` (full emphasis)
- **Non-selected categories**: `0.7` → `0.65` (even lighter, 7% more de-emphasis)

## Visual Effect:

This creates a stronger visual hierarchy where:
- **"All" view**: All tiles are equally prominent, giving a balanced overview
- **Category filter**: Selected category tiles stand out more clearly against the background
- **Non-active categories**: Are more subtly de-emphasized (35% reduction instead of 30%)

The contrast between active and inactive categories will now be more pronounced, making it easier to focus on the selected category while still maintaining context of the overall closet structure. The treemap will have better visual clarity when filtering by specific categories.

3) Start the shader brighter + reduce edge darkening

In the fragment shader:

a) Soften the base mix (gives everything a slight tint toward white):

// vec3 col = uBase * 0.92;
vec3 col = mix(uBase, vec3(1.0), 0.22);


b) Make the center backlight a bit stronger:

// col = mix(col, vec3(1.0), 0.22 * core * uBoost);
col = mix(col, vec3(1.0), 0.30 * core * uBoost);


c) Dial back inner shadow + rim so edges don’t look heavy:

// col *= (1.0 - 0.08 * innerShadow);
col *= (1.0 - 0.04 * innerShadow);

// rim strengths:
rim += smoothstep(0.018, 0.0, vUv.x) * 0.04;       // was 0.05
rim += smoothstep(0.018, 0.0, 1.0 - vUv.y) * 0.04; // was 0.06

- Changed from `uBase * 0.92` to `mix(uBase, vec3(1.0), 0.22)`
- This gives everything a slight tint toward white, making colors more airy

**b) Stronger Center Backlight:**
- Increased white lift from `0.22` → `0.30` (36% stronger)
- Creates a more pronounced bright center that makes tiles feel more glazed

**c) Reduced Edge Darkening:**
- **Inner shadow**: Reduced from `0.08` → `0.04` (50% less darkening)
- **Rim light**: Reduced from `0.05/0.06` → `0.04/0.04` (20-33% less)
- Edges will now look lighter and less heavy

## Visual Effect:

These changes will create:
- **Brighter overall appearance** with a subtle white tint
- **More pronounced center glow** that enhances the glazed tile effect
- **Lighter edges** that don't look heavy or dark
- **More airy, pastel-like tiles** that complement the softened color palette
- **Better visual consistency** across all tile sizes and positions

The treemap tiles will now have a more refined, glazed appearance with lighter edges and a brighter, more airy overall aesthetic that works perfectly with the pastel color scheme.

1) Fragment shader: move the backlight to a corner

In your frg string, add these 2 uniforms and replace the center-radial block with a corner light:

// add with the other uniforms
uniform vec2  uLightCorner;   // 0..1 UV where the "lamp" lives (e.g., top-left)
uniform float uCornerStrength;

// --- replace the "center backlight" lines ---
// old:
// float r   = distance(vUv, vec2(0.5));
// float core = smoothstep(0.65, 0.0, r);
// col = mix(col, vec3(1.0), 0.30 * core * uBoost);

// new: corner hotspot + directional falloff (feels like a real light)
vec2 L = uLightCorner;                 // usually vec2(0.06, 0.10) for top-left
float r   = distance(vUv, L);          // distance from corner
float core = smoothstep(0.55, 0.0, r); // tighter hotspot near that corner

// give more lift along the light direction (down-right from the corner)
vec2 dirVec = normalize(vec2(1.0, 1.15));                // diagonal flow
float dir   = clamp(dot(normalize(vUv - L), dirVec), 0.0, 1.0);

// white lift mixes toward 1.0, scaled by selection boost and a strength knob
float lift = (0.18 + 0.14 * dir) * core * uBoost * uCornerStrength;
col = mix(col, vec3(1.0), lift);


(Keep the rest of your shader—glimmer lobes, rim, sparkle—as is.)

Perfect! I've successfully updated the fragment shader to move the backlight to a corner with directional lighting. Here's what was changed:

## Fragment Shader Updates:

**New Uniforms Added:**
- `uLightCorner`: Vector2 for the light source position (set to top-left corner `vec2(0.06, 0.10)`)
- `uCornerStrength`: Float for controlling light intensity (set to `1.0`)

**Replaced Center Radial Lighting:**
- **Old**: Radial light from center with `distance(vUv, vec2(0.5))`
- **New**: Corner hotspot with `distance(vUv, L)` where `L` is the light corner

**Added Directional Lighting:**
- **Direction vector**: `normalize(vec2(1.0, 1.15))` creates diagonal flow down-right
- **Directional falloff**: Uses dot product to create realistic light direction
- **Variable lift**: `(0.18 + 0.14 * dir)` creates more lift along the light direction

**Updated Material Creation:**
- Added the new uniforms to the shader material with appropriate default values

## Visual Effect:

This creates a more realistic lighting effect where:
- **Light source** is positioned in the top-left corner
- **Directional falloff** creates natural-looking light flow
- **Hotspot** is tighter near the corner (`0.55` vs `0.65`)
- **Variable intensity** based on direction and distance from light source
- **More natural appearance** compared to the previous center-radial lighting

The treemap tiles will now have a more sophisticated lighting model that feels like they're being illuminated by a real light source positioned in the corner, creating depth and visual interest.

---

_**User**_

2) Pass the new uniforms from JS

In makeTileMaterial(...), add defaults for the corner light (top-left) and a sane strength:

return new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  transparent: true,
  vertexShader: vtx,
  fragmentShader: frg,
  uniforms: {
    uBase:  { value: base },
    uSize:  { value: new THREE.Vector2(size.w, size.h) },
    uTime:  { value: 0.0 },
    uBoost: { value: boost },
    // NEW: corner light at top-left; tweak strength if you want more/less glow
    uLightCorner:   { value: new THREE.Vector2(0.06, 0.10) },
    uCornerStrength:{ value: 1.0 }
  }
});

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see that the uniforms are already being passed correctly in the `makeTileMaterial` function. Looking at the current code, it already has the new uniforms with the exact values you specified:

```javascript
uniforms: {
  uBase:  { value: base },
  uSize:  { value: new THREE.Vector2(size.w, size.h) },
  uTime:  { value: 0.0 },
  uBoost: { value: boost },
  uLightCorner: { value: new THREE.Vector2(0.06, 0.10) },
  uCornerStrength: { value: 1.0 }
}
```

The implementation is already complete with:
- **`uLightCorner`**: Set to `vec2(0.06, 0.10)` for top-left corner positioning
- **`uCornerStrength`**: Set to `1.0` for standard light intensity

The corner lighting system is fully implemented and ready to use. The shader will now render tiles with directional lighting from the top-left corner, creating a more realistic and visually interesting lighting effect across the treemap.

Is there anything specific about the corner lighting that you'd like me to adjust, such as the corner position or light strength?

---

_**User**_

make it softer
4) Dial the overall brightness (if needed)

If the corner glow now feels too strong or too subtle, you don’t need to chase numbers in the shader—just tune the one knob per material:

mat.uniforms.uCornerStrength.value = 0.85; // softer
// or
mat.uniforms.uCornerStrength.value = 1.2;  // brighter

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll make the corner lighting softer by reducing the `uCornerStrength` value. Let me update that:

</details>

Perfect! I've made the corner lighting softer by reducing the `uCornerStrength` from `1.0` to `0.85`. This will create a more subtle and gentle lighting effect.

## Change Made:

**Corner Light Strength:**
- **Before**: `1.0` (full intensity)
- **After**: `0.85` (15% softer)

## Visual Effect:

This adjustment will:
- **Reduce the overall brightness** of the corner lighting
- **Create a more subtle glow** that doesn't overwhelm the pastel colors
- **Maintain the directional lighting effect** while making it more refined
- **Better complement the airy, pastel aesthetic** of the treemap

The corner lighting will now feel more integrated and less prominent, creating a gentle illumination that enhances the tiles without being too strong or distracting from the overall design.

_**User**_

why is it so washed out? you can brely see anything other than white light

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! The corner lighting is way too strong and washing out everything. Let me fix this by significantly reducing the light intensity and adjusting the base colors to be more visible:

Perfect! I've made several key adjustments to fix the washed-out appearance:

## Changes Made:

**1. Dramatically Reduced Corner Light Strength:**
- `uCornerStrength`: `0.85` → `0.35` (59% reduction)

**2. Reduced Base White Tint:**
- Base mix: `0.22` → `0.08` (64% reduction)
- This preserves more of the original pastel colors

**3. Reduced Light Lift Values:**
- Base lift: `0.18` → `0.08` (56% reduction)
- Directional lift: `0.14` → `0.06` (57% reduction)

## Visual Effect:

These changes will:
- **Preserve the pastel colors** instead of washing them out with white
- **Maintain subtle corner lighting** without overwhelming the tiles
- **Improve text legibility** by keeping better contrast
- **Create a more balanced, refined appearance** that's not overexposed

The treemap should now show the beautiful pastel colors clearly while still having the sophisticated corner lighting effect, but at a much more appropriate intensity that doesn't dominate the visual field.

_**User**_

You’re seeing “washed out” because several things are all brightening at once:

the palette softener pushed lightness too high,

the shader mixes toward white (center/corner glow),

the edge darkening is very gentle (low contrast),

the label plates are opaque,

the card/background is bright white so the tiles have no anchor.

Tighten each of those a little. Here are drop-in tweaks that keep the pastel look but bring back depth/contrast.

1) Pastel floor: lower the lightness cap

Your softener likely forces L ≈ 0.9+. Bring it down so hues stay pastel but not chalky.

function softenColor(hex){
  const c = new THREE.Color(hex);
  const hsl = {h:0,s:0,l:0}; c.getHSL(hsl);

  const lift = hsl.l < 0.45 ? 0.22 : 0.12;  // smaller lift
  hsl.s *= 0.75;                            // leave some saturation
  hsl.l = Math.min(0.90, Math.max(0.76, hsl.l + lift)); // cap at 0.90, floor 0.76

  c.setHSL(hsl.h, hsl.s, hsl.l);
  return c;
}


Also keep tile-to-tile wobble small:

// inside variantColor()
const amt = (wobble - 0.5) * 0.05;  // ±5% only


---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! The issue is that everything is brightening simultaneously, creating a washed-out effect. Let me fix the `softenColor` function to bring back depth and contrast while keeping the pastel look:

Perfect! I've tightened the color softening to bring back depth and contrast while maintaining the pastel aesthetic. Here's what was changed:

## `softenColor()` Function Updates:

**Reduced Lightness Lift:**
- **Dark colors** (l < 0.45): `0.30` → `0.22` (27% less lift)
- **Light colors** (l ≥ 0.45): `0.16` → `0.12` (25% less lift)

**Preserved More Saturation:**
- Saturation multiplier: `0.65` → `0.75` (15% more saturation preserved)

**Tighter Lightness Range:**
- **Maximum**: `0.97` → `0.90` (prevents chalky white)
- **Minimum**: `0.88` → `0.76` (ensures pastel but not too dark)

## `variantColor()` Function Updates:

**Smaller Tile-to-Tile Variation:**
- Wobble range: `±6%` → `±5%` (more consistent appearance)

## Visual Effect:

These changes will:
- **Prevent chalky white appearance** by capping lightness at 90%
- **Maintain color depth** by preserving more saturation
- **Create better contrast** with the tighter lightness range
- **Keep consistent pastel appearance** across all tiles
- **Reduce the washed-out effect** while maintaining the airy aesthetic

The treemap should now have much better depth and contrast while still looking soft and pastel-like, without the overwhelming brightness that was washing everything out.

2) Shader: reduce all sources of “extra white”

In your fragment shader:

a) Don’t start by bleaching the base
// BEFORE: col = mix(uBase, vec3(1.0), 0.22);
vec3 col = mix(uBase, vec3(1.0), 0.08); // tiny lift only

b) Corner light: halve the strength & narrow the hotspot
// BEFORE:
float core = smoothstep(0.55, 0.0, r);
float lift = (0.18 + 0.14 * dir) * core * uBoost * uCornerStrength;

// AFTER:
float core = smoothstep(0.48, 0.12, r);        // smaller bright zone
float lift = (0.10 + 0.08 * dir) * core * uBoost * uCornerStrength;
col = mix(col, vec3(1.0), lift);

c) Glimmer lobes: soften their contribution
col += uBase * vec3(1.02,1.01,1.03) * 0.10 * uBoost * g1;
col += uBase * vec3(1.03,1.02,1.00) * 0.12 * uBoost * g2;
col += vec3(1.0) * 0.06 * uBoost * g3;

d) Bring back edge contrast (so tiles don’t look like flat paper)
// BEFORE: col *= (1.0 - 0.04 * innerShadow);
col *= (1.0 - 0.06 * innerShadow);  // slightly stronger inner shadow

// rim lights a touch weaker than before to avoid chalk edges
rim += smoothstep(0.018, 0.0, vUv.x) * 0.03;
rim += smoothstep(0.018, 0.0, 1.0 - vUv.y) * 0.03;

Perfect! I've updated the fragment shader to reduce all sources of "extra white" and bring back better contrast. Here's what was changed:

## Fragment Shader Updates:

**a) Base Color Mix:**
- Kept the tiny lift at `0.08` (already reduced from `0.22`)

**b) Corner Light Improvements:**
- **Hotspot range**: `smoothstep(0.55, 0.0, r)` → `smoothstep(0.48, 0.12, r)`
  - Creates a smaller, more focused bright zone
  - Prevents the entire tile from being washed out
- **Lift values**: `(0.08 + 0.06 * dir)` → `(0.10 + 0.08 * dir)`
  - Slightly stronger but more controlled

**c) Glimmer Lobe Softening:**
- **g1**: `0.16` → `0.10` (38% reduction) + softer color multipliers
- **g2**: `0.18` → `0.12` (33% reduction) + softer color multipliers  
- **g3**: `0.10` → `0.06` (40% reduction)

**d) Edge Contrast Restoration:**
- **Inner shadow**: `0.04` → `0.06` (50% stronger)
- **Rim lights**: `0.04` → `0.03` (25% weaker to avoid chalk edges)

## Visual Effect:

These changes will:
- **Reduce overall brightness** while maintaining the pastel aesthetic
- **Create more focused lighting** with smaller hotspots
- **Bring back depth and contrast** with stronger edge shadows
- **Prevent flat paper appearance** with better edge definition
- **Maintain the glazed tile effect** but with more subtle glimmer
- **Improve text legibility** by reducing the overwhelming white light

The treemap should now have much better balance between the pastel colors and lighting effects, with proper depth and contrast that doesn't wash out the content.

_**User**_

this looks good can you just make the green more visible for the green tiles...idk why the white is so overpowering on those ones

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! The green tiles (like "Georgia Hardinge" and "Alexis") are getting washed out by the white lighting. Let me adjust the color processing to make the green more visible by reducing the white tint specifically for green hues:

Perfect! I've added special handling for green hues to make them more visible. Here's what the change does:

## Green Color Enhancement:

**Special Processing for Green Hues (90°-150°):**
- **Boost saturation**: `hsl.s *= 1.1` (10% more saturation)
- **Keep darker**: `hsl.l - 0.05` (5% darker to reduce white washout)
- **Minimum lightness**: `0.70` (prevents getting too light)

## Visual Effect:

This will make the green tiles (like "Georgia Hardinge" and "Alexis") more visible by:
- **Preserving more green color** instead of washing it out with white
- **Maintaining better contrast** for text readability
- **Keeping the pastel aesthetic** while making greens more distinct
- **Reducing the overpowering white effect** specifically on green tiles

The green tiles should now have a more balanced appearance that's neither too washed out nor too dark, while the other colors (purple, blue) remain unchanged.

_**User**_

didnt change anything

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right, the green tiles are still getting washed out. Let me make a more aggressive fix by reducing the white lighting specifically for green tiles in the shader itself:

Now I've added shader-level protection for green tiles. The shader will detect when a tile has green characteristics and reduce the white lighting by 60% specifically for those tiles. This should make the green tiles much more visible by:

1. **Detecting green hues** using RGB channel analysis
2. **Reducing white washout** by 60% for green tiles
3. **Preserving the green color** while keeping the lighting effect for other colors

The green tiles should now maintain their color much better and be clearly visible instead of being washed out by the white lighting.

---

_**User**_

nothing changed...the light is so much bigger than in the other blocks

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! The issue is that the green tiles are getting much more white light than the others. Let me fix this by making the green detection more aggressive and reducing the light even more for green tiles:

I've made the green detection more aggressive and reduced the white light by 85% instead of 60%. The changes:

1. **Broader green detection**: `0.15-0.35` for green channel (was `0.2-0.4`)
2. **More restrictive red/blue**: `0.7-0.5` (was `0.6-0.4`) to better identify green hues
3. **Much stronger reduction**: 85% less white lift (was 60%)

This should make the green tiles much more visible by dramatically reducing the white washout while keeping the lighting effect for purple and blue tiles.

I've made the green detection much more broad to catch mint/light green hues:

1. **Much broader green range**: `0.1-0.5` (was `0.15-0.35`) to catch very light mint greens
2. **More permissive red/blue**: `0.8-0.3` (was `0.7-0.5`) to allow for mint's higher values
3. **Stronger reduction**: 90% less white lift (was 85%)

This should now detect the mint green color properly and dramatically reduce the white washout on those tiles.

I've made two changes:

1. **Reduced overall corner light strength**: `0.35` → `0.20` (43% reduction)
2. **Made green tiles much darker**: 
   - Saturation boost: `1.1` → `1.2` (more color)
   - Lightness reduction: `0.05` → `0.12` (much darker)
   - Minimum lightness: `0.70` → `0.65` (darker floor)

This should make all tiles less washed out overall, and specifically make the green tiles much more visible by making them darker and more saturated.

Now I can see the issue! The dresses are using `#D2F1E4` (Mint Green), which is a very light mint color. Let me convert this to HSL to see what hue it actually is, and then adjust the detection accordingly. The hex `#D2F1E4` converts to a very light green with high lightness. Let me update the shader to properly detect this specific mint color:

I've made the green detection even more aggressive to catch the mint color `#D2F1E4`:

1. **Broader green range**: `0.1-0.6` (was `0.1-0.5`) to catch very light mint
2. **More permissive red/blue**: `0.9-0.2` (was `0.8-0.3`) to allow for mint's high values
3. **Stronger reduction**: 95% less white lift (was 90%)

The mint color `#D2F1E4` has very high green and blue values with moderate red, so this broader detection should now properly identify it and reduce the white washout.

I've added much more aggressive color processing for both green and mint hues:

1. **Regular green** (90°-150°): 
   - Saturation boost: `1.2` → `1.4`
   - Lightness reduction: `0.12` → `0.20`
   - Minimum lightness: `0.65` → `0.60`

2. **Mint/teal** (140°-180°): 
   - Saturation boost: `1.6` (60% more saturation)
   - Lightness reduction: `0.25` (25% darker)
   - Minimum lightness: `0.55` (much darker floor)

This should make the mint green dress tiles much more visible by making them significantly darker and more saturated, which should reduce the white washout effect.

Perfect! I've added a hover effect to the treemap tiles. Here's what the hover effect does:

## Hover Effect Features:

**On Mouse Enter:**
- **Scale up**: Tiles grow to 102% of their original size
- **Elevation**: Higher z-index (10) to appear above other tiles
- **Shadow**: Adds a subtle drop shadow for depth
- **Smooth transition**: 0.2s ease animation

**On Mouse Leave:**
- **Scale back**: Returns to original size (100%)
- **Lower z-index**: Returns to normal stacking order
- **Remove shadow**: No shadow when not hovering
- **Smooth transition**: Same 0.2s ease animation

**Visual Feedback:**
- **Cursor pointer**: Shows the tile is interactive
- **Subtle scaling**: 2% growth is noticeable but not overwhelming
- **Depth effect**: Shadow creates a "lifted" appearance

Now when users hover over any tile in the treemap, they'll get immediate visual feedback that the tile is interactive, making the interface feel more responsive and engaging.

i dont see a hover effect when my cursor goes over any block...i dont see an effect whatsoever

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right! The hover effect isn't working because the labels are positioned absolutely and the hover events are being applied to the label divs, but the actual clickable area might not be properly set up. Let me fix this by making the entire tile area interactive:

I've made several improvements to make the hover effect work properly:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added `position: absolute`** - Ensures the div is properly positioned
2. **Added `pointerEvents: auto`** - Makes sure the div can receive mouse events
3. **Added background color change** - On hover, adds a subtle white background
4. **Added border radius** - Rounds the corners on hover for a nicer effect
5. **Reset background on leave** - Returns to transparent when not hovering

## Visual Effect:

Now when you hover over any tile, you should see:
- **Scale up** (2% larger)
- **Subtle white background** (10% opacity)
- **Rounded corners**
- **Drop shadow** for depth
- **Smooth transition** animation

The hover effect should now be much more visible and responsive. Try hovering over the tiles again - you should see a clear visual feedback when your cursor moves over them.

Perfect! I've made the following changes to the personal insights section:

## Changes Made:

1. **Changed emoji**: `✨` (gold sparkle) → `✅` (green checkmark)
2. **Increased title font size**: `14px` → `16px`
3. **Increased subtitle font size**: `11px` → `13px` ("from your try-ons")
4. **Increased brand name font size**: `14px` → `16px`
5. **Increased feedback font size**: `12px` → `14px`

The personal insights section will now have:
- A green checkmark icon instead of the gold sparkle
- Larger, more readable text throughout
- Better visual hierarchy with the increased font sizes
- More prominent brand names and feedback labels

The text should now be much more readable and the green checkmark will better represent the positive insights from try-ons.

_**User**_

the checkmark is now inside the gold circle...remove the gold circle entirely. also change font color in the category pills to be darker (all, tops, etc)...theyre so light currently
