# Fix mockup display in section 3 (2025-08-29 18:12-0400)

_**User**_

look at the code for section 3 of @index3.html . the three side by side mockups are not appearing correctly. they should appear exactly like @closet-screen.html in section 2. right now the frames are too small and they are zoomed in on the mockup screens. make them match @closet-screen.html

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating frame display issues**

I'm noticing that the frames look too small and zoomed in on the mockup screens, so I think the scale should match the closet screen. The closet screen in section 2 uses a transform that scales down to 68%. But since the three mockups also use this transform, they might appear zoomed in due to differences in aspect ratios or width constraints. It's possible that overflow hidden in .mock-inner is causing cropping. I need to consider the nested styles for the iframes too.
**Examining iframe scaling issues**

I notice that the transform properties apply to all .mock iframes, including those in section 3 where we're looking for a consistent scale with section 2. If the frames are too small and zoomed in, this might be due to the CSS scaling set at 0.68 again in the .three-mockups as well. Another potential issue could be that the containing .mock is not width-limited, combined with the grid setup for three mockups. I really need to keep all these factors in mind!
**Analyzing aspect ratios and scaling**

I'm thinking about the aspect ratio of .mock-inner, which is 430/932, and how the scaling factor of 0.68 impacts the size. The width of the card could be 1fr of the container's total width, but scaling down creates leftover blank areas that may look zoomed in instead of out. In section 2, the setup for the mock was different compared to section 3, where transparency changed the visual context. The way items are nested in the grid also influences how the width of each column is calculated. There are a lot of details to consider!
**Addressing scaling issues**

The screenshot shows that the frames appear too small, suggesting that the scaling is reduced too much. I think in section 2, the container width allowed for a larger size. However, in section 3, the 1fr width makes the effective visible size smaller. The user wants the frames to match the closet-screen.html appearance from section 2, which has no black frame. With the three-column grid, we might need to adjust the transform scale for #demo to something like 0.95 or 1.0. But if it's zoomed in, that usually means the content inside the iframe is oversized and cropping at the edges!
**Clarifying framing and scaling issues**

The frames seem too small and zoomed in, likely due to the screen being scaled while the container size is small, leading to cropping. The user wants them to match the appearance of closet-screen.html in section 2. The scaling issues could originate from the grid in section 3, which may make columns narrower. We need to reduce the transform scale for #demo to fit the 430 width content better. The problem may stem from the iframe dimensions and how the content inside is rendered, leading to unexpected cropping and zoomed effects!
**Addressing iframe scaling and layout issues**

It seems that the iframe content is experiencing cropping because the content width (430) exceeds the iframe's viewport width (346). To fix this, I need to adjust the transform scale to ensure it matches the container properly. By setting the iframe's width to 430px and height to 932px, I can effectively prevent overflow, while maintaining the desired aspect ratio. Ensuring the iframe scales correctly with a transform of scale(0.68) should help fit within the narrower column and eliminate the zoomed-in effect caused by the current setup.
**Implementing CSS updates for iframes**

I'm ready to update the CSS rules for the mockup presentation to ensure the iframes appear correctly. I'll add new styles for the `.mock-inner` and adjust the iframe dimensions to 430px by 932px to maintain consistency. It's essential to place this patch right after the existing CSS block to prevent conflicts, especially since the earlier rules target iframe width generically. I need to ensure the new settings override the existing ones without causing any issues. After the patch, I'll double-check the CSS for accuracy before finalizing everything.</details></think>

I'll update the CSS in `index3.html` to make the three mockups in Section 3 use a fixed 430x932 viewport like Section 2 and then scale them, eliminating the zoom/cropping and matching the frameless presentation.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing iframe sizing**

I’m reflecting on how iframes take their size from either their attributes or CSS. Without CSS, they default to 300x150, but it seems they looked okay due to some parent CSS adjustments. In another section, there were specific overrides that set the iframe to fill the container's dimensions, which could lead to content appearing cropped or zoomed in. It’s a bit confusing since “too small and zoomed in” feels contradictory, but I think it means the visible content is zoomed in within a smaller phone frame.
**Revising iframe dimensions**

I’m realizing that the transform scale of 0.68 reduces the size of the iframe, which results in hidden overflow cropping. To fix this, I think we should change the width and height settings in section 3 to specific values, like width: 430 and height: 932, instead of using width: 100% and height: 100% for the iframes. I added overrides for these dimensions, but I see there's a CSS order issue with conflicting rules. As long as the final rule applies last, it should take precedence!
**Adjusting transform scale**

I’m thinking about how to adjust the transform scale for consistency, as we kept it at 0.68 for the three-mockups. This should yield a similar outcome to section 2. The container .mock-inner has an aspect ratio, and with the iframe set to 430 for the width, it's possible that the container might overflow if it ends up being smaller. The scaling reduces the drawn size to about 292.4 px, which could prevent overflow, but the left alignment may look a bit off. The grid columns might also reduce the width on desktop to around 360 px each.
**Revising iframe content scaling**

I’m evaluating the dimensions: at about 360 px wide and 780 px high for the container, the iframe content scaled to approximately 292 px width fits inside it. Since the container width is greater than the iframe width, there should be some padding on the sides, which is okay. However, the screenshot may appear too small and zoomed. It might be better to use the exact CSS from the #how mock for the iframes, ensuring we maintain the aspect ratio of 430/932 for both #how and #demo. Finally, I’ll check the underlying HTML for the closet-screen effect.
**Running lint checks**

I think the next step is to run the lint checks to ensure there are no errors in the HTML. Even if the linter might return nothing, it’s still important to call the functions.read_lints tool. The task seems simple, so I might consider skipping creating a todo list, but we still have to do a status update and provide a summary of changes. I’ll include a status line indicating, “Now I'll check for linter errors” before proceeding with read_lints. Finally, I’ll deliver a brief summary of what was changed, possibly mentioning the CSS selectors.</details></think>

I'll check the file for any linter issues after the CSS update.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing scaling effects**

I’m noticing that using width/height at 100% could fill the container, but applying a transform of 0.68 keeps it reduced, resulting in letterboxing. Perhaps there's a need to display the entire internal edges of the phone. In Section 2, the phone has a transparent background with no framing. For Section 3, they mention zooming in on mockup screens, which potentially indicates that the iframe content gets scaled up, leading to cropping. The CSS transform scale may cause some discrepancies if the dimensions are set incorrectly.
**Optimizing CSS rules**

I'm thinking that to match the closet screen in Section 2, I should apply the same CSS rules to .three-mockups in #how. Using `.mock:has(iframe)` ensures a transparent background, while `.mock-inner` maintains an aspect ratio of 430/932 and a transform scale of 0.68 for the iframe. In #demo, I already set the background transparency and aspect ratio, but I should update the width and height to 430 and 932 for both sections. I’ll also make sure to fix that empty style attribute in L296 and check for any other empty occurrences.
**Adjusting transformations**

I'm considering that we may need to tweak the transform if the recent changes lead to an oversized appearance. However, since the request is to match Section 2, I should maintain the transform at 0.68. It seems like we’ve already matched the necessary aspects, so let’s go ahead and perform the edit as planned. I want to make sure everything aligns properly while keeping the required transform in place.</details></think>

I'll remove the empty `style=""` attribute causing the linter warning and keep the CSS changes.

- I updated `index3.html` CSS so Section 3 iframes use a fixed 430x932 viewport and the same scale/translation as Section 2, removing the tiny, cropped look. I also removed an empty inline `style` to clear the linter warning.

- Key edits:
  - Added rules so `#how .mock-inner iframe` and `#demo .three-mockups .mock-inner iframe` are 430x932, matching the phone viewport.
  - Preserved the frameless presentation and matching transform used in Section 2.
  - Cleaned `<div class="left-col">` by removing `style=""`.
