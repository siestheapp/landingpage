_**User**_

can you do a commit of the entire project since i just added the new @closet-screen.html 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you commit the entire project including the new `closet-screen.html` file. Let me first check the current git status and then create a commit.

---

```bash
cd /Users/seandavey/Downloads/web && git status
```

```

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .specstory/history/2025-08-27_23-41-0400-revert-to-first-com
mit.md
        modified:   profile-screen.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .specstory/history/2025-08-28_01-02-0400-improve-profile-screen-for-fema
le-shoppers.md
        closet-screen.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

Now I'll add all the changes and create a commit:

---

```bash
git add .
```

```
seandavey@MacBook-Air-3 web % git add .
seandavey@MacBook-Air-3 web %
```

---

```bash
git commit -m "Add closet screen with visual-first design and update project files"
```

```
seandavey@MacBook-Air-3 web % git commit -m "Add closet screen with visual-first design and update project f
